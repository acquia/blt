[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/acquia/blt.svg?branch=8.x)](https://travis-ci.org/acquia/blt) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/blt/badge/?version=8.x)](http://blt.readthedocs.io/en/8.x/?badge=8.x) [![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/acquia/blt.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/acquia/blt)

BLT (Build and Launch Tool) is a tool that generates new Drupal projects using a standardized template derived from Acquia Professional Services' best practices.

You can find all BLT documentation on [Read the Docs](http://blt.readthedocs.io).

## Getting started

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to:

* [Create a new project with BLT](https://github.com/acquia/blt/blob/8.x/INSTALL.md#creating-a-new-project-with-blt)
* [Add BLT to an existing project](https://github.com/acquia/blt/blob/8.x/INSTALL.md#adding-blt-to-an-existing-project)
* [Update BLT](https://github.com/acquia/blt/blob/8.x/INSTALL.md#updating-blt)

## Philosophy and Purpose

BLT is designed to improve efficiency and collaboration across Drupal projects by providing a common set of tools and standardized structure. It was born out of the need to reduce re-work, project set up time, and developer onboarding time.

Its explicit goals are to:

* Provide a standard project template for Drupal based projects
* Provide tools that automate much of the setup and maintenance work for projects
* Document and enforce Drupal standards and best practices via default configuration, automated testing, and continuous integration

It scope is discretely defined. It is *not* intended to provide:

* Drupal application features (e.g., workflow, media, layout, pre-fabbed content types, etc.)
* A local hosting environment
* A replacement for good judgement (as with Drupal, it leaves you the freedom to make mistakes)

## Features

* [Git Hooks](template/scripts/git-hooks)
    * pre-commit: Checks for Drupal coding standards compliance
    * commit-msg: Check for proper formatting and syntax
* [Testing Framework](template/tests).
    * Behat: default `local.yml` configuration, example tests, `FeatureContext.php`
    * PHPUnit: default tests for ensuring proper functioning of BLT provided components
* [Project tasks](readme/project-tasks.md)
    * Executing tests and validating code
    * Building dependencies
    * (Re)installation of Drupal
* [Artifact Generation](readme/deploy.md)
* [Continuous Integration & Deployment](readme/ci.md)
    * [Acquia Pipelines](https://dev.acquia.com/request-invite-acquia-pipelines) (coming soon)
    * [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com)
    * [GitHub](https://github.com)
