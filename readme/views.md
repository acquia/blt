## Building Views

The following are guidelines for building new views.

* _Caching_ 
    * For all public facing views, always use some form of caching. A non time-based cache is preferable because it often permits the longest cache lifetimes, and invalidates caches only when necessary. Possible options are:
        * [Views content cache](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_content_cache)
        * [Views argument cache](https://www.drupal.org/project/views_arg_cache)
        * Time based
* _Pagination_
    * Always specify either a fixed number of results or a pager. Never display all results. 
    * Whenever possible, use Views lite pager rather than a full pager. 
        * Note that this is unfortunately mutually exclusive with caching due to bugs in Views Lite Pager. @see https://www.drupal.org/node/2285591.
* _Advanced_
    * Always add a semantically descriptive machine name to views displays. E.g., use `press_releases_all` rather than `page_1`. This makes all PHP, CSS, and JS related to the view display more readable.
* _Relationships_
    * Whenever possible, use "require this relationship" for all views relationships. This causes views to perform an inner join rather than a left join, and is almost always faster.
    * Never use the `Taxonomy Terms on Node` relationship or filter. Instead, use a relationship or filter for the specific taxonomy reference field. This has a tremendous performance impact.
* _Filters_ 
    * For all exposed filters, manually set the fitler identifier to something end-user friendly. This should not contain drupalisms. E.g., use `type` rather than `field_type`.
* _No Results Behavior_
    * Always add "No Results behavior" of some type. This is typically text informing that user that no results were found.

@todos:

* When to ditch Views in favor of EFQ or straight queries. There's a reason Advanced Forum is slow on big sites.
* Proper views naming and tagging
