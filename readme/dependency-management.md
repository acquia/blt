# Dependency Management

## Composer usage overview

Composer should be used to manage Drupal core, all contributed dependencies, and most third party libraries. The primary exception to this is front end libraries that may be managed via a front-end specific dependency manager, such as [Bower](http://bower.io/) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

[Why do we use Composer](http://blog.nelm.io/2011/12/composer-part-1-what-why/) for dependency management? It is the dependency manager used by Drupal core.

Make sure to **familiarize yourself** with [basic usage](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md) of Composer, especially on how the [lock file](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#composer-lock-the-lock-file) is used. In short: you should commit _both_ `composer.json` and `composer.lock` to your project, and every time you update `composer.json`, you must also run `composer update` to update `composer.lock`. You should never manually edit `composer.lock`.

**You should understand**:

* Why [dependencies should not be committed](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md)
* The role of [composer.lock](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#composer-lock-the-lock-file)
* How to use [version constraints](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md)
    * [Why using unbound version constraints is a bad idea](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/why-are-unbound-version-constraints-a-bad-idea.md)
* [The difference](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16679589/whats-the-difference-between-require-and-require-dev) between `require` and `require-dev`

### Recommended tools and configuration

* Globally install pretissimo for parallelized composer downloads:

        composer global require "hirak/prestissimo:^0.3"

* If you have xDebug enabled for your PHP CLI binary, it is highly recommended that you disable it to dramatically improve performance.

### Contributed projects and third party libraries

All contributed projects hosted on drupal.org, including Drupal core, profiles, modules, and themes, can be found on Drupal Packagist, a drupal.org hosted packagist server. You must specify this special URL in your `composer.json` so that Composer is able to discover such packages:

      {
          "repositories": {
              "drupal": {
                  "type": "composer",
                  "url": "https://packages.drupal.org/8"
              }
          }
      }

Most non-Drupal libraries can be found on [Packagist](http://packagist.com/). For any required packaged not hosted on one of those two sites, you can define your own array of [custom repositories](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#repository) for Composer to search.

Note that Composer versioning is not identical to drupal.org versioning.

## Add dependencies

To add a new package to your project, use the `composer require` command. This will add the new dependency to your `composer.json` and `composer.lock` files, and download the package locally. E.g., to download the pathauto module run,

        composer require drupal/pathauto

Commit `composer.json` and `composer.lock` afterwards.

## Update dependencies (core, profile, module, theme, libraries)

To update a single package, run `composer update [vendor/package]`. E.g.,

        composer update drupal/pathauto --with-dependencies

To update all packages, run `composer update`.

Commit `composer.json` and `composer.lock` afterwards.

## Remove dependencies

To remove a package from your project, use the `composer remove` command:

        composer remove drupal/pathauto

Commit `composer.json` and `composer.lock` afterwards.

## Patch a project

Please see [patches/README.md](../template/patches/README.md) for information on patch naming, patch application, patch ignoring, and patch contribution guidance.

### Modifying BLT's default Composer values

BLT merges default values for composer.json using [wikimedia/composer-merge-plugin](https://github.com/wikimedia/composer-merge-plugin):

        "merge-plugin": {
            "require": [
                "vendor/acquia/blt/composer.required.json",
                "vendor/acquia/blt/composer.suggested.json"
            ],
            "include": [
                "blt/composer.overrides.json"
            ],
            "merge-extra": true,
            "merge-extra-deep": true,
            "merge-scripts": true,
            "replace": false,
            "ignore-duplicates": true
        },

This merges the `require`, `require-dev`, `autoload`, `autoload-dev`, `scripts`, and `extra` keys from BLT's own vendored files. The merged values are split into two groups

 1. composer.require.json: These packages are required for BLT to function properly. You may change their versions, but you should not remove them.
 1. composer.suggested.json: You may remove the suggested packages by deleting the `vendor/acquia/blt/composer.suggested.json` line from your composer.json.

If you'd like to override the default version constraint for a package provided by BLT, you may simply define the desired version in your root composer.json file. Note that it order for this to work, your configuration for the merge plugin must include:

        "replace": false,
        "ignore-duplicates": true


### Merging in additional composer.json files

In situations where you have local projects, e.g. a custom module, that have their own composer.json files, you can merge them in by including the composer-merge-plugin. Reference these additional composer.json files in the `extra` section of your root composer.json file.

        "extra": {
          "merge-plugin": {
            "require": [
              "docroot/modules/custom/example/composer.json"
            ]
          }
        }

## Front end dependencies

Drupal 8 does not have a definitive solution for downloading front end dependencies. The following solutions are suggested:

* Load the library as an external library. See [Adding stylesheets (CSS) and JavaScript (JS) to a Drupal 8 module](https://www.drupal.org/developing/api/8/assets).
* Use a front end package manager (e.g., [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)) to download your dependencies. Then use BLT's `source:build:frontend-assets` target-hook to trigger building those dependencies. E.g., call `npm install` in your theme directory via these hooks. See [Frontend management](frontend.md) for more information.
* Commit the library to the repository, typically in `docroot/librares`.
*  Add the library to composer.json via a [custom repository](https://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md). Designate the package as a `drupal-library` and define a `installer-paths` path for that package type to ensure that it is installed to `docroot/libraries.` Ensure that it can be discovered in that location. See [example composer.json](https://gist.github.com/mortenson/a5390d99013b5b8c0254081e89bb4d47).

Contributed projects should provide the ability to download and discover the libraries. If you are using a contributed project, it is suggested that you patch the project to support one of these strategies.

If you cannot, then commit the dependency. You can use a custom .gitignore file for you project, [ensure that it is copied to the deployment artifact, and supply your own, custom .gitignore file to be used in the deployment artifact](extending-blt.md#deploybuild).
