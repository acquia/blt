If you experience issues with a local BLT build, try using Dr. BLT to diagnose your problem:

    blt doctor

If that isn't helpful, please post an issue on the [GitHub issue queue](https://github.com/acquia/blt/issues) including the following information:

- Your version of BLT, `composer info acquia/blt`
- Your operating system
- The full log output of your BLT command, wrapped in a [codeblock](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#quoting-code).
