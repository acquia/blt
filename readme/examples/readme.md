# Introduction
The purpose of these examples is to provide a starting point for common custom development tasks. There are many ways to approach implementing features in Drupal and these examples show some common solutions.

These modules are working examples. It's recommended that you copy the module and test that it works and then begin to modify the files to fit your need.

## Modules
These example modules demonstrate how to create and theme custom components including panels. This also demonstrates how to work with javascript, libraries, and other assets.

## Themes
The theming examples focus on the theme build process and foundational structure of the theme. There are many ways to approach frontend theming. For now, the examples do not assume any particular approach to creating the CSS or Javascript or particular markdown.

As such, this is NOT a base theme. This is intended as a structure to get a project started using common build process tools.
