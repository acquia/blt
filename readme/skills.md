# Minimum Skillset for Using BLT
BLT is a tool that reaches far beyond Drupal development, and because of this developers planning on using it should working knowledge of the following technologies in order to be successful.

See the [System Requirements](../INSTALL.md) for installing / using BLT. It is strongly urged that you use a Mac for local development, although certain versions of Linux and Windows 10 can also be used. Other operating systems ***should not*** be used for BLT development.
 
## Enterprise Web Development

### Development Environment
BLT can be operated on any "LAMP" stack that will run Drupal. Acquia provides several tools for this, but they are optional.

#### [DrupalVM](https://www.drupalvm.com/)
This project aims to make spinning up a simple local Drupal test/development environment incredibly quick and easy, and to introduce new developers to the wonderful world of Drupal development on local virtual machines (instead of crufty old MAMP/WAMP-based development).

#### [DevDesktop](https://www.acquia.com/products-services/dev-desktop)
Acquia Dev Desktop is a free app that allows you to run and develop Drupal sites locally on your computer and optionally host them using Acquia Cloud. Use Acquia Dev Desktop to evaluate Drupal, add and test other Drupal modules, and develop sites while on a plane or away from an internet connection.

### Dependency Management

#### [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

## Version Control

### [Git](https://git-scm.com)
Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any files.
