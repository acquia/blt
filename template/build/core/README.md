This directory contains the core tasks that ship with BLT. No files in this
directory should be customized. You may pull in upstream changes with:

    ./blt.sh setup:blt:update

Please note that pulling in upstream changes in this way may break your project.
In some cases, you will need to change aspects of your project configuration or
modify your project's directory structure.
