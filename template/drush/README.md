# Drush configuration and aliases

The `drush` directory is intended to contain drush configuration that is not site or environment specific.

Site specific drush configuration lives in `sites/[site-name]`.

## Site aliases

### For remote environments

You should add the Drush aliases for any remote environments (such as Acquia Cloud) to the `sites` directory. This allows developers to access remote environments using simple aliases such as `drush @mysite.dev uli`. Note that if you are using Acquia Cloud, developers can also download these aliases manually from their Insight account, but providing them with the project makes everyone’s life a little easier.

You can find these aliases for Acquia Cloud sites by logging into https://accounts.acquia.com and going to the _Credentials_ tab on your user profile. Download and place the relevant alias file into `sites`.

Note that if the version of Drush that your project uses is significantly ahead of the version available in the remote environment, you’ll need to manually set `$drush_major_version` at the top of your alias files to match the version of Drush on the remote environment. For instance, at the time this document is being written, Drush 9 is in development and only Drush 8 is available on Acquia Cloud, so you’d want to add the following to the top of your aliases: `$drush_major_version = 8;`

### For local environment

It can be helpful to define aliases for a local environment such as `@mysite.local`. This creates consistency with how aliases are already defined for remote environments (such as `@mysite.dev`, `@mysite.test`, and `@mysite.prod`). To create these local aliases, copy `example.local.aliases.drushrc.php` to `local.aliases.drushrc.php` and modify the default values as appropriate for your project.
