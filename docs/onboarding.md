# Onboarding

This document is intended for developers who have joined a project that *already has BLT installed.* It is a quick-start guide for getting your local development environment set up and getting oriented with the project standards and workflows.

*If you are attempting to add BLT to a project or create a new BLT-based project, do not use this document.* Instead, refer to [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Before you start...

You have probably been linked to this documentation by a project that is using BLT to accelerate its development, testing, and deployment. While we strongly recommend exploring all of the BLT documentation, here's what's most important to do and know before getting started:

* BLT is distributed as a Composer package. This means that the project you are working on requires BLT as a dependency in its composer.json file. This also means that you don't need to install or configure BLT globally on your machine, or as a separate tool--simply run `composer install` on the parent project and install a tiny bash alias (as described below), and you're good to go.
* You will need some project-specific information to set up your local environment, specifically whether you are using a virtual development environment (e.g., DrupalVM), and the name of your mainline development branch (`develop` or `master`). This should be referenced in your project's README.
* If you need help, check with your project team first, since they may have already encountered any issue you are experiencing. Then post an issue in the [BLT issue queue](https://github.com/acquia/blt/issues). The issue queue isn't only for bugs--we welcome feedback on all aspects of the developer experience.
* Verify that your local system and network meet the [BLT system requirements](INSTALL.md). Also ensure that you have dependencies installed for any virtual development environment (such as [VirtualBox and Vagrant for DrupalVM](local-development/#using-drupal-vm-for-blt-generated-projects)).
* Because BLT makes use of a variety of best practice development tools and processes (Composer, Git, etc...), you should verify that you have the necessary [skillset(s)](skills.md) to develop with BLT.

## Initial Setup

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the primary GitHub repository for the project you are developing
1. Clone your fork to your local machine (by convention, BLT refers to your fork as "origin" and the primary repo as "upstream"):

         git clone git@github.com:username/project-repo.git
         git remote add upstream git@github.com:acquia-pso/project-repo.git

1. If your project uses separate `master` and `develop` branches, checkout the `develop` branch: `git checkout develop`
1. Run `composer install` (you must already have Composer installed).
1. Install `blt` alias: `./vendor/bin/blt blt:init:shell-alias -y`. At this point you might need restart your shell in order for the alias work.

If your project uses a virtual development environment such as [Drupal VM](local-development/#using-drupal-vm-for-blt-generated-projects):

1. Start the VM: `vagrant up`
1. SSH into the VM: `vagrant ssh`
1. Build and install the Drupal installation: `blt setup`

If your project does not use a virtual development environment:

1. Setup your local LAMP stack with the webroot pointing at you project's `docroot` directory.
1. Run `blt blt:init:settings` This will generate `docroot/sites/default/settings/local.settings.php` and `docroot/sites/default/local.drush.yml`. Update these with your local database credentials and your local site URL.
1. Run `blt setup`. This will build all project dependencies and install drupal.

Please see [Local Development](local-development.md) for more information on setting up a local \*AMP stack or virtual development environment.

## Ongoing development

As development progresses, you can use the following commands to keep your local environment up to date:

- Run `blt setup` to rebuild the codebase and reinstall your Drupal site (most commonly used early in development).
- Run `blt drupal:sync` to rebuild the codebase, import a fresh DB from a remote environment, and run schema/configuration updates (most commonly used later in development).

Each of these commands is simply a wrapper for a number of more granular commands that can be run individually if desired (for instance, `blt drupal:update` just runs database updates and imports configuration changes). For a full list of available project tasks, run `blt`. See [Project Tasks](project-tasks.md) for more information.

### Adding settings to settings.php

A common practice in Drupal is to add settings to the `settings.php` file to control things like cache backends, set site variables, or other tasks which do need a specific module. BLT provides two mechanisms to add settings to settings.php. Settings files may be added to the `docroot/sites` directory for inclusion in all sites in the codebase or settings can be added via an `includes.settings.php` in the `settings` directory of an individual  site (i.e., `docroot/sites/{site-name}/settings/includes.settings.php`). Both mechanisms allow settings to be overriden by a `local.settings.php`, to support local development. 

> **Important**: When using BLT, settings should not be simply added directly to `settings.php`. This is especially true with Acquia Cloud Site Factory, which will ignore settings added directly to `settings.php`.

The first level of BLT's settings management is the `blt.settings.php` file. When sites are created, BLT adds a require line to the standard `settings.php` file which includes the `blt.settings.php` file from BLT's location in the `vendor` directory. This file then controls the inclusion of other settings files in a hierarchy. The full hierarchy of settings files used by BLT looks like this:

```
  sites/{site-name}/settings.php
    |
    ---- blt.settings.php
           |
           ---- sites/settings/*.settings.php
           |
           ---- sites/{site-name}/settings/includes.settings.php
           |       |
           |       ---- foo.settings.php
           |       ---- bar.settings.php
           |       ---- ....
           |
           ---- sites/{site-name}/settings/local.settings.php
 ```
 
 > **Important**: Do not edit the `blt.settings.php` file in the `vendor` directory. If you do, the next time composer update or install is run your changes may be lost. Instead, use one of the mechanisms described below. 
 
#### Global settings for the codebase
To allow settings to be made once and applied to all sites in a codebase, BLT [globs](http://php.net/manual/en/function.glob.php) the `docroot/sites/settings` directory to find all files matching a `*.settings.php` format and adds them via [PHP require](http://php.net/manual/en/function.require.php) statements.

As not all projects will need additional global settings, BLT initially deploys a `global.settings.default.php` file into the `docroot/sites/settings` directory. To make use of this file, rename it to `global.settings.php` and settings or required files as needed.

 
#### Per site
On a per-site basis, BLT uses an `includes.settings.php` file in the `settings` directory of each individual site. Any settings made in that file, or other files required into it, will be added to the settings for that particular site only.

As not all projects will need additional includes, BLT initially deploys a `default.includes.settings.php` file into the site's `docroot/sites/{site_name}/settings` directory. To make use of this file, rename it to `includes.settings.php` and add the path to the file(s) which should be added.

### Local Git Configuration

For readability of commit history, set your name and email address properly:

    git config user.name "Your Name"
    git config user.email your-email-address@example.com

Ensure that your local email address correctly matches the email address for your Jira account.

## Updating your local environment

The project is configured to update the local environment with a local drush alias and a remote alias as defined in `blt/blt.yml` or `blt/local.blt.yml`. Given that these aliases match those in `drush/sites/`, you can update the site with BLT.

## GitHub Configuration

In order to more easily identify developers in a project, please be sure to set a name and profile picture in your GitHub profile.

When working with GitHub, the [hub](https://github.com/github/hub) utility can be helpful when managing forks and pull requests. Installing hub largely depends on your local environment, so please follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/github/hub#installation) accordingly.

## Next steps
