Minimum skill set for using Acquia BLT
======================================

Acquia BLT is a tool that reaches far beyond Drupal development, and
developers planning on using it should have a working knowledge of
the following technologies to be successful.

For information about installing and using Acquia BLT, see
:doc:`/blt/install`. It is strongly urged that you use a Mac for local
development, although certain versions of Linux and Windows 10 can also be
used. Other operating systems **should not** be used for Acquia BLT
development.


.. _blt-enterprise-web-development:

Enterprise web development
--------------------------

Acquia BLT can be operated on any *LAMP* stack that will run Drupal.

Development environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Drupal VM <https://www.drupalvm.com/>`__: The goal of this project is
   to make creating a local Drupal test and development environment
   quick and easy, and to introduce new developers to the world of Drupal
   development in local, virtual environments (instead of MAMP- or WAMP-based
   development).
-  :doc:`/dev-desktop/`: Acquia Dev Desktop is a free application that
   allows you to run and develop Drupal sites locally on your computer and
   optionally host them using Acquia Cloud. Use Acquia Dev Desktop to evaluate
   Drupal, add and test other Drupal modules, and develop sites while on a
   plane or away from an internet connection.

Dependency management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`__: Composer is a tool for
   dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your
   project depends on and it will manage (install and update) them for you.
