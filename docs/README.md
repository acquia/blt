BLT (Build and Launch Tool) provides an automation layer for testing, building, and launching Drupal 8 applications.

You can find all BLT documentation on [Read the Docs](http://blt.readthedocs.io):

* [Latest release documentation (10.x)](http://blt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (best for guidance on general issues and best practices)
* [LTS release documentation (9.2.x)](http://blt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (best for features specific to 9.2.x)

## Getting started

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for a list of prequisites and links to instructions for [creating new projects](creating-new-project.md), [adding BLT to existing projects](adding-to-project.md), and [updating BLT](updating-blt.md).

## Releases and versioning

BLT generally has an LTS release, supported stable release, and unstable (HEAD) release at any given time, each corresponding to a major [semantic version](https://semver.org/). The newest supported major version will receive both bug fixes and new features, while the penultimate ("LTS") major version will receive bug fixes for at least two months (or longer if necessary in order to match pinned versions of Drupal or Drush).

### Release support status

| Major Version | Support Status              | Drupal | Drush          | Dev Status   |
|---------------|-----------------------------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| 10.x          | Unsupported (Beta)          | >=8.6  | >=9.5.0        | \*active dev |
| 9.2.x         | Supported                   | 8.6    | >=9.4.0        | \*active dev |
| 9.x           | LTS, EOL May 2019           | 8.5    | >=9.1.0        | \*bug fixes  |
| <=8.9.x       | Unsupported, EOL            | <=8.5  | ~8             |              |

### Branch details

The 10.x branch is considered a major release because it requires PHP 7+ and removes the Composer merge plugin that BLT previously used to manage dependencies.

The 9.x branch will be supported until Drupal 8.5.x is EOL (May 2019).

## Philosophy and Purpose

BLT is designed to improve efficiency and collaboration across Drupal projects by providing a common set of tools and standardized structure. It was born out of the need to reduce re-work, project set up time, and developer onboarding time.

Its explicit goals are to:

* Provide a standard project template for Drupal based projects
* Provide tools that automate the setup, testing, launching, and maintenance work for projects
* Document and enforce Drupal standards and best practices via default configuration, automated testing, and continuous integration

Its scope is discretely defined. It is *not* intended to provide:

* Drupal application features (e.g., workflow, media, layout, pre-fabbed content types, etc.)
* A local hosting environment
* A replacement for good judgement (as with Drupal, it leaves you the freedom to make mistakes)

## Features

* [Local Git Hooks](https://github.com/acquia/blt/tree/9.x/scripts/git-hooks)
    * pre-commit: Checks for Drupal coding standards compliance
    * commit-msg: Check for proper formatting and syntax
* [Testing Framework](https://github.com/acquia/blt/tree/9.x/template/tests).
    * Behat: default `local.yml` configuration, example tests, `FeatureContext.php`
    * PHPUnit: default tests for ensuring proper functioning of BLT provided components
* [Commands to automate project tasks](project-tasks.md), like:
    * Test execution
    * Frontend asset compilation
    * Syncing environments
* [Deployment Artifact Generation](deploy.md)
    * Building production-only dependencies
    * Sanitation of production code
* [Continuous Integration & Deployment](ci.md)
    * [Acquia Pipelines](https://dev.acquia.com/request-invite-acquia-pipelines)
    * [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com)
    * [GitHub](https://github.com)
