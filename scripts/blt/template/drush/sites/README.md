This directory should contain Drush site aliases. These aliases can be generated in several ways:
* Using the `blt recipes:aliases:init:acquia` command (for Acquia Cloud applications)
* Using the [acsf-tools](https://github.com/acquia/acsf-tools) package
* By downloading aliases directly from Acquia Cloud (not recommended--use one of the above tools if possible)
* Manually, based on the [Drush examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drush-ops/drush/master/examples/example.site.yml).
