Installation profiles define additional steps that run after the base installation provided by Drupal core when Drupal is first installed.

WHAT TO PLACE IN THIS DIRECTORY?
--------------------------------

Place custom installation profiles in this directory. Installation profiles are generally provided as part of a Drupal distribution. They only impact the installation of your site. They do not have any effect on an already running site.

MULTISITE CONFIGURATION
-----------------------

In multisite configurations, installation profiles found in this directory are available to all sites during their initial site installation.

MORE INFORMATION
----------------

Refer to the "Installation profiles" section of the README.txt in the Drupal root directory for further information on extending Drupal with custom profiles.
