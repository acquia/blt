#
# Example site definition file for remote and local environment information for a
# site within a multisite installation.
#
# Values in this file may override default values set elsewhere. You can pass
# configuration from this file to Phing. E.g.,
# blt tests:behat -propertyfile build/custom/phing/example.multisite.yml
#
# This file may also be placed in blt/sites, where its filename should correspond to
# docroot/sites/[site-name] (E.g., default.yml for docroot/sites/default). You should
# create one file in the blt/sites directory for each site running against your
# codebase when taking this approach.
