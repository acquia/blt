# BLT installation

*Please do not clone BLT as a means of using it. The only reason to clone BLT is to contribute to it.

## System requirements

You must have the following tools on the command line of your *host operating system*:

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
* [PHP 5.6+](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php) (though PHP 7.1+ is recommended)

Instructions for installing _all_ requirements for various operating systems are listed below. In general, make sure all installed tools are the most recent version unless otherwise noted.

### Networking considerations

Building project dependencies requires that your local machine make HTTP and HTTPS requests to various software providers on the internet. Please ensure that your local and network level security settings permit this to happen.

If you need to make requests via a proxy server, please [configure git to use a proxy](http://stackoverflow.com/a/19213999). This will cover all git based requests made by Composer

## Installing requirements

### Mac OSX

Ensure that [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) is installed (primarily in order to support Homebrew). On OSX 10.9+ you can install Xcode with:

        sudo xcodebuild -license
        xcode-select --install

Then install the minimum dependencies for BLT. The preferred method is via Homebrew, though you could install these yourself without a package manager.

        /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
        brew install php71 git composer
        composer global require "hirak/prestissimo:^0.3"
 
Note that the recommended installation method for Drush has changed recently. Drush should only be installed as a dependency of individual projects, rather than being installed system-wide. BLT will manage this dependency for you on projects, but in order for you to run Drush commands independently of BLT commands you'll want to install the Drush Launcher according to its intructions: https://github.com/drush-ops/drush-launcher

If you'd like to create a [Drupal VM](https://www.drupalvm.com/) with BLT, you will require the following additional libraries. If you'd like to use a LAMP stack other than Drupal VM, see [Local Development](readme/local-development.md).

        brew tap caskroom/cask
        brew cask install virtualbox vagrant
        vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater
        
If you are not using a VM, and you'd like to execute Behat tests from the host machine, you will need Java:

        brew cask install java
        brew cask install chromedriver

BLT ships with the [Cog Base Theme](https://github.com/acquia-pso/cog) by default. Cog uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install front end tools. If you intend to use Cog, you should also install the following tools:

        brew install npm nvm

### Windows

Windows is currently supported only when using the [Bash on Ubuntu on Windows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about) feature available in the latest version of Windows 10.

Pre-requisite requirements:
  - You must be running a 64-bit version of Windows 10 Anniversary update (build 14393 or later)
  - Access to a local account with administrative rights for initial install

Follow the official [installation guide](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide).

Note you **must** create a UNIX username with a password when prompted at the final step in the process. Certain BLT commands will not function correctly if you install with a passwordless root account.

Once complete follow the [BLT on Windows installation instructions](readme/windows-install.md).

### Linux

If you are using a Linux machine, it is assumed that you will not be using Drupal VM and that you will be configuring your own LAMP stack. Disregard the `blt vm` command and `@[project.machine_name]` references in subsequent documentation.

#### Ubuntu / Debian

        apt-get install git composer drush
        composer global require "hirak/prestissimo:^0.3"

#### Fedora

        dnf install git composer drush
        composer global require "hirak/prestissimo:^0.3"
