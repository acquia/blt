 * Use this file to add any addition settings files which should be required by

 * add file references to the `additionalSettingsFiles` array below.
 *
 * Files required into this file are included into the blt.settings.php file
 * prior to the inclusion of the local.settings.php file, so that that file may
 * override any variable set up the chain. Taken in total, the points at which
 * files are included into the base settings.php file are...
 *
 * settings.php
 *   |
 *   ---- blt.settings.php
 *          |
 *          ---- includes.settings.php
 *          |       |
 *          |       ---- foo.settings.php
 *          |       ---- bar.settings.php
 *          |       ---- ....
 *          |
 *          ---- local.settings.php
 *
 * If you want to add settings to every site defined in the codebase, you can do
 * so using the global.settings.default.php file in docroot/sites/settings.
